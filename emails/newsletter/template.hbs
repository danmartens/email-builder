    {{#> section heading="✨ Recent Work" imageSrc=section1ImageUrl}}
      In preparation for the release of Queens,
      [Kilotype’s](https://kilotype.de) largest font family to date,
      type designers William Montrose and Sebastian Losch wanted to add
      a simple and beautiful purchasing grid to the website we designed
      and built for them in 2018. We worked with them to refine and
      implement a solution that transforms complex font, license, and
      style selections into a soothing and satisfying experience.
      Student licenses are also now available!

      Our collaboration with Figure 53 – makers of the industry standard
      live performance software, QLab – continued over the past year
      after they reached out to team up with us again for a redesign of
      [Figure53.com](https://figure53.com). Through a discovery process,
      we helped separate [QLab](https://qlab.app), a reliable, focused,
      professional-grade product, from the squishy real-life humans that
      make it, making way for a holistic redesign of each site under the
      Figure 53 Umbrella.

    {{#> section heading="🎭 Around Baltimore"}}
      Some Friends attended the first performance and opening night at
      [The Voxel](https://voxel.org)! If you’re a local or visiting
      Baltimore, we recommend going to see The Acme Corperation’s _The
      First Thing That Happens_ through March 1st or another show in the
      future.
